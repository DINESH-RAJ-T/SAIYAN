        <h3>Vegeta, as the Prince of Saiyans, held a strong sense of pride and believed in the Saiyan warrior code, which emphasized strength and dominance.<br>
            He viewed Goku as a "common trash" Saiyan, a low-class warrior who should have been far weaker than him.<br>Vegeta was constantly humiliated by Goku's unexpected power increases, which made Vegeta feel inadequate and challenged his belief in his own superiority. <br>
